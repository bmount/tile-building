Load a collection of buildings using polygons of their footprints, with an optional height property.

There's also some stuff in here for doing visualizations of buildings over arbitrary
spaces a la [this](http://tilebldg.cityrewrite.com/place.html), and
for loading a bunch of building footprint vertices with an optional simple binary
format in addition to geojson.
